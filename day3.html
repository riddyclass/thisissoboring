    	<center><h1>Hello, world!</h1></center>

<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br />
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br />
The evil that men do lives after them;<br />
The good is oft interred with their bones;<br />
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br />
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<br />
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br />
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.<br />
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--<br />
For Brutus is an honourable man;<br />
So are they all, all honourable men--<br />
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</p>

<p>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br />
But Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br />
He hath brought many captives home to Rome<br />
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br />
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br />
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:<br />
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br />
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
And Brutus is an honourable man.</p>

<p>You all did see that on the Lupercal<br />
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br />
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br />
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br />
And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br />
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br />
But here I am to speak what I do know.<br />
You all did love him once, not without cause:<br />
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?<br />
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br />
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br />
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br />
And I must pause till it come back to me</p>
